title: Bucket List
---

I recently had a conversation with my fiance, in which we discussed our respective goals for our lives, and how we want to achieve them. The only problem was that I didn't have anything more concrete than "Help people", "have a family", "make a difference". Here's my attempt to pin down a set of specific and measurable goals for me to work towards, as well as some classic "bucket list" item. I'm throwing it up on the web to keep me honest.

1. Marry Kelly Noah
2. Adopt a dog
3. Have a child
4. Purchase a home to live in myself
5. Purchase a rental property
6. Make $10,000 from something that is not my day job
7. Write a technical book of more than 100 pages
8. Appear by name in a major publication
9. Become the CTO of a company
10. Donate $100,000 to charity
11. Contribute to an open source project with more than 100 contributors
12. Contribute to an Apache Foundation project
13. Write something read by more than 1,000 people
14. Write something read by more than 10,000 people
15. Get a Master's in Computer Science
16. ~~Run a marathon~~ **(July 23, 2017)**
17. Qualify for the Boston Marathon
18. ~~Get a tattoo~~ **(April 2, 2018)**
19. Donate 20 gallons of blood
20. Read 1,000 books - Track at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/33541735?shelf=read)
21. Visit every continent
22. Learn to speak German fluently
23. Build something that saves 10 human lives
24. Be a vegetarian for 1 year
25. Achieve financial independence
26. Build an application used by 1,000 people
27. Build an application used by 10,000 people

I'll hope to add to this list as my priorities change, but I won't remove from it. It's surprisingly difficult to pin down a set of things that I want to accomplish in my life. Do you have a list?
