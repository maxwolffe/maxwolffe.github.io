# Hi, I'm Max

I'm a Student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm passionate about teaching, learning, and building cool things. I'm also an Undergraduate Student Instructor for [CS61A][cs61a], a Developer for [Blueprint][blueprint], and the Director of Logistics for [TEDxBerkeley][tedxberkeley]. You can send me an email [here][max-email].

# About This Site

This site is made using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Hyde][hyde], an awesome static site generator and a great theme to accompany it respectively. I'll be using it to host CS61A information, projects, and maybe a blog. Feel free to look at the [repository][repo] and let me know if you have any feedback. Inpiration from [Chris Banes][chrisB]

Thanks for visiting!
