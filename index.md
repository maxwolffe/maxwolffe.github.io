# Hi, I'm Max

I've just graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm passionate about teaching, learning, and building cool things. While at Berkeley I was an Undergraduate Student Instructor for [CS61A][cs61a], a Developer for [Blueprint][blueprint], an Undergraduate Research Assistant with the [NetSys][netsys] lab, and the Director of Logistics for [TEDxBerkeley][tedxberkeley].

I'll be starting in August as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn.

You can send me an email [here][max-email].

Thanks for visiting!
